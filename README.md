This is a start off on git control version and github public repositories.
The act of committing (e.g. a database transaction or source code into a source control repository), making it a permanent change.
GitHub is a centralized repository. It is used for project version control (multiuse can update: upload, edit and manage the code files).
Github helps you to track or manage your version controlled projects locally.
Github operations: commit, pull, push and perform all the other operations.
Github Branches: They help you to work on different versions of a repository at one time allowing you to move back and forth between the different states/versions of a project without affecting the main branch - the master brach - i.e., the last version of the project officially updated
there is a master/ production branch which has a new branch for testing. Under this branch (different name), two set of changes are done and once it completed, it is merged back to the master branch. So this is how branching works!

## How to use GitHub: Operations
### Commit Command:(note: now I'm using a new branch named readme-changes. Then I've already used the commit message operation)
This operation helps you **to save** the changes in your file. When you commit a file, you should always provide the message, just to keep in the mind the changes done by you. Though this message is not compulsory but it is always recommended so that it can differentiate the various versions or commits you have done so far to your repository. **These commit messages maintain the history of changes** which in turn help other contributors to understand the file better. Now let’s make our first commit, follow the below steps:
Click on “readme- changes” file which we have just created.
Click on the “edit” or a pencil icon in the righmost corner of the file.
Once you click on that, an editor will open where you can type in the changes or anything.  
Write a commit message which identifies your changes.
Click commit changes in the end. 
**Pull requests** let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are **merged** into the base branch.
