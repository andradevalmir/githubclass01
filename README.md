This is a start off on git control version and github public repositories.
The act of committing (e.g. a database transaction or source code into a source control repository), making it a permanent change.
GitHub is a centralized repository. It is used for project version control (multiuse can update: upload, edit and manage the code files).
Github helps you to track or manage your version controlled projects locally.
Github operations: commit, pull, push and perform all the other operations.
Github Branches: They help you to work on different versions of a repository at one time allowing you to move back and forth between the different states/versions of a project without affecting the main branch - the master brach - i.e., the last version of the project officially updated
there is a master/ production branch which has a new branch for testing. Under this branch (different name), two set of changes are done and once it completed, it is merged back to the master branch. So this is how branching works!
